I'm Shaivi, an **ECE AI student** at **Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women**, a tech enthusiast exploring everything **AI & Python**.

When Iâ€™m not training models or debugging, youâ€™ll find me:

-  **Vibing to music**  
-  **Creating art**  
-  **Dancing like nobodyâ€™s watching**  
-  **Deciphering lifeâ€”one meme at a time** :D

Always up for **cool AI projects, deep tech convos, and a good cup of coffee** â˜•âœ¨.
