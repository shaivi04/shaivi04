# Hi there! Wassup?  

I'm Shaivi, an **ECE AI student** at **Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women**, a tech enthusiast exploring everything **AI & Python** 🤖🐍.

When not coding, I'm probably:  
🎶 Vibing to music  
🖌️ Creating art  
💃 Dancing like nobody's watching  
😂 Scrolling through memes (duh)  

Always up for **cool AI projects, deep tech convos, and a good cup of coffee** ☕✨.
