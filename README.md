# Hi there!

I'm Shaivi, an **ECE AI student** at **Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women**, a tech enthusiast exploring everything **AI & Python**.

When I’m not training models or debugging (read: staring at error logs existentially), you’ll find me:
🎵 Vibing to music  
🖌️ Creating art  
💃 Dancing like nobody's watching  
😂 Deciphering life—one meme at a time

Always up for **cool AI projects, deep tech convos, and a good cup of coffee** ☕✨.
