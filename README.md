# Hi there!

I'm Shaivi, an **ECE AI student** at **Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women**, a tech enthusiast exploring everything **AI & Python**.

When Iâ€™m not training models or debugging (read: staring at error logs existentially), youâ€™ll find me:

> Vibing to music  
> Creating art  
> Dancing like nobody's watching  
> Deciphering lifeâ€”one meme at a time :D

Always up for **cool AI projects, deep tech convos, and a good cup of coffee** â˜•âœ¨.
